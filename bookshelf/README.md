## Unsolved Problems and hurdles we had to overcome

For the major hurdles we had to overcome we can mention below points:
- connecting our backend routes to the interface was one of the initial challenges.
- to compartmentalise the front end components was another challenge especially when using mui for css framework.
- implementing the borrow and return functionalities were challenging in terms of integration with database.
- resolving git conflicts where we were working on the same features was also a hurdle we had to overcome.
